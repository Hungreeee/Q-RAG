# Q-RAG

## Overview

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained popularity as a method to incorporate non-parametric memory space to LLM agents, allowing them to gain access to more knowledge while avoiding the computational overhead from fine-tuning. RAG operates by retrieving relevant documents and augmenting them as grounding context to every user input, thereby helping to enhance LLM's response accuracy and relevance. This is particularly powerful in knowlege-intensive tasks such as question answering.

However, RAG systems may fail to obtain relevant context when human queries become too complex, resulting in poor answers. The core problem is that semantic search engines rely on the contextual similarity between questions and documents rather than verifying the presence of answers. As a result, a document might be contextually relevant but lack the information needed to answer the question. In light of this, there has been a research direction aiming to develop corrective methods to address scenarios where the retrieval performance is poor. This includes utilizing web search when the retrieved context is incorrect to the query, or forming a query rewriting loop until context retrieval is satisfied, etc. However, in a sense, most of these are not truly "corrective":

- Methods similar to utilizing knowledge base extension such as web search is not truly corrective. They merely allow agents to gain access to a larger knowledge base, which clearly can still result in bad context retrieval.
- Generally, these methods will go through another "corrective process" everytime the same complex question (or similar variants of it) is provided. In other words, they will try to solve the same problem again rather than leaving some kind of trajectory for future similar problems to follow, which can be quite inefficient in terms of cost and time. 

To address these issues, we introduce Q-RAG, a corrective RAG paradigm that enables answer correction from external intervention (e.g., human annotators) to prevent the agent from repeating bad retrieval. 

#### Question-based Retrieval:

Q-RAG revolves around using "model questions" for context retrieval. These "model questions" are examples of questions that can be answered by certain chunks. To express this relationships, the model questions are linked to certain chunks containing the answer. During the retrieval process, new input questions can be matched with similar model questions, returning the connected chunks.

This question-based approach allows user questions to be directly matched with examples of questions that could already be answered. Combining this with vanilla chunk retrieval, Q-RAG help the LLM generator to receive not only contextually relevant chunks but also chunks that contain answers. 

#### Corrective Process:

But how can the system generate these "model questions" and link them to relevant information chunks in the first place? Q-RAG improves its retrieval process by "correcting" poor context retrieval using ground truth answers. This adjustment helps it obtain better context for similar questions in the future. Here's a more detailed look of this plays out:

- The RAG retriever fails to retrieve relevant context from the database. 
- Poor context leads to poor answers. These can be detected by some evaluation method such as metric tracking, low user rating, etc. 
- An external source (e.g., human evaluator) provides the corrected context chunks. This can be achieved by providing the corrected answer, then use it to search for relevant chunks (using semantic search, BM-25, etc.). The intuition is that having the ground truth answers for retrieval will result in chunks with considerably higher chances of containing the true answers. 
- Connect the initial question to the corrected chunks, then append them to the database.
- Next time, when similar questions are asked, the retriever can match the input question with the new model question, returning the connected chunks (plus chunks from vanilla RAG).

In the scenario above, it is possible to observe the agent can somewhat "learn" from corrected question-chunks to obtain better chunks when similar input are met next time. With this corrective mechanism, it is possible to simulate some kind of "training" for the RAG retriever. For instance, before deploying a Q-RAG chatbot, one can start out by ingesting a model question-answering dataset on their documents into the corrective process. This enables the Q-RAG retriever to "learn" question-chunk connections, allowing it to correctly handle similar questions that potentially will appear in the future. 

#### Benefits:

- With a simple set-up, Q-RAG is efficient in terms of cost and can be easily adapted to any existing RAG pipelines.
- Q-RAG allows humans to address poor retrieval, helping the agent avoid making the same mistake when similar question patterns are asked. 
- In certain QnA settings, new questions would start to appear less with time. Therefore, intuitively, the situation will somewhat converge to the scenario where every complex question can be handled by Q-RAG.
